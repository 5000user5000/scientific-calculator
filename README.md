# scientific-calculator

使用c#來做一個工程計算機windows視窗應用程式

(Using c# to make a scientific-calculator)

此計算機有幾乎所有工程計算機該有的功能

(This calculator includes almost all functions of scientific-calculator)

此程式是用visual studio2019開發的winform,因為我覺得沒必要全部檔案上傳,所以只上傳最重要的Form1.cs和Form1.Designer.cs

(This winform program was developed by visual studio2019.Because I think it was unneeded to upload the whole file,I just uploaded the most important files,such as "Form1.cs" and form1.Designer.cs )

附註:

(p.s.)

刪除鍵的圖是由網路上找到圖檔再把他放入button的image特性中

(the image on delete button was found on the internet,and I uploaded in my button's image  properties)



這個計算機的缺點是無法像小算盤那樣,輸入一整排的算式,然後程式讀取輸入來計算.這裡是像實體的計算機那樣,每按一個新數字就會清除輸出螢幕原本的數字,畢竟要做到能用括號等等一長串的輸入難度過高

(The flaw of this calculator is that it can't input a lot of equations. Like physical calculator,every time you press a new number,the screen will clean the old number.After all,it is hard to calculate with brackets. )

製作步驟大概就是先設計計算機的長相,之後每一個按鍵的功能,以及我認為最困難的是四則運算,先加減後乘除

(The step to make it can roughly be described by 1.design the appearance of the calculator 2.design the function of the buttons when clicked 3.the most difficult part Arithmetic-> * / before + -)

代碼的注釋是用中文

(The comments in code are in Mandarian)

這是我的作業,當初在做的時候,花了滿多時間和滿多資料.希望之後有人做一樣作業時會發現這個代碼.

(This is my homework.I had spended lots of time making it and searching tons of data. Hope someone who need to make the same homework may find this one day.)
